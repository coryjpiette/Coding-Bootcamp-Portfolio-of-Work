Portfolio of Work

Please use the below-referenced link to view my portfolio of work.

The website navigates successfully to the "About Me," "Work," and "Contact Me" sections.

In About Me, I have included a headshod, short biography, and links to my resume and LinkedIn profile.

In Sample Work, I have included five distinct sections that cover different programming languages and areas of focus.

In contact Me, I have included a link to my email address and (for now) a fake phone number.
