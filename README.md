Homework #2 - Portfolio of Work

The website navigates successfully to the About Me, Sample Work, and Contact Me seciotns.

In About Me, I have included a headshot and bio.

In Sample Work, you can hover over different images to link to sample work products. The first is my novel and the other two are random novels. The apps enlarge when hovered.

In contact Me, I have included a link to my email address and a fake phone number.

Images and text size adjust to fit screens at 992px and 768px.
