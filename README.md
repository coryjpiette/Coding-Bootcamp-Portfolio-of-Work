## Navigation

At the top of the webpage, you are provided with three navigation links: "About Me," " Sample Work," and "Contact Me."

Clicking each link will direct you to a separate section as described below:

## Information

In About Me, I have included a headshot, short biography, and links to my resume and LinkedIn profile.

## Samples

In Sample Work, I have provided links to five separate projects, each utilizing varying programming languages and APIs. 

The most recently completed project will always appear in the largest of the five windows.

## Contact

In contact Me, I have included a link to my email address, a fake phone number (for now), and, once again, my LinkedIn profile.
