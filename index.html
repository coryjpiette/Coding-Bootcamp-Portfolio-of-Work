            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering and from Penn State University with an MBA in Finance and Supply Chain Management. Iâ€™ve spent the majority of my post-college career working in the financial industry, primarily in fixed income and derivative securities. In 2017 I published my first novel, a techno-thriller titled The Demeter Initiative, which will be rebranded and republished in late 2021. The Demeter Initiative is the first of three intended novels in the Demeter series. My primary focus areas are Finance, Supply Chain Management, and Information Technology.
